        This digital catalogue presents documented human rights violations in Liberia's recent history.
        The aim is to preserve memory, raise awareness, and support future education and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The material is thematically organized and includes both witness accounts and summaries of events
        related to massacres, imprisonment, sexual violence, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each entry represents a small part of a larger history that deserves to be seen, read, and remembered.
